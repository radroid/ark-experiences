## Code Quality & Style

- Use strict TypeScript everywhere. Avoid `any` and unsafe casts.
- Embrace functional, declarative programming; avoid classes and OOP patterns.
- Limit files to ≤150 lines. If exceeded, refactor into smaller modules.
- Prefer iteration and composition over duplication. Be DRY.
- Use descriptive, semantic names with auxiliaries: `isLoading`, `hasError`, `shouldRender`.
- Directories and files use lowercase-dash naming: `components/auth-wizard`.
- Favor named exports for components and utilities.
- Use RORO: functions receive one object and return one object.
- Keep components small and focused. Extract hooks and utilities when logic grows.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID). Budget images, defer non-critical JS, prefetch where appropriate.
- Run regular refactors and code reviews to enforce consistency.
