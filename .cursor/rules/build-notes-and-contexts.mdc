## Project Docs: Build Notes & Contexts

- Build Notes live in `/ProjectDocs/Build_Notes/`. Naming: `build-title_phase-#_task-group-name.md`.
- Notes must include: Task Objective, Current State Assessment, Future State Goal, Implementation Plan (with checklists). Append-only; never delete plan items.
- Update notes at task start, during execution (changes/difficulties), and completion (summary).
- On completion move notes to `/ProjectDocs/Build_Notes/completed/`; if deprecated, to `/ProjectDocs/Build_Notes/archived/`.
- Master context `projectContext.md` lives in `/ProjectDocs/contexts/`. Stable, updated only for significant scope changes.
- Additional contexts (`uiContext.md`, `feature-*.md`) are stable references. Record any context changes inside relevant Build Notes for traceability.
